## Low Code Platforms - Tyler Application Platform

### **💰 Cost Transparency Across Your Projects**

Every Tyler Application feature now tracks and displays token usage and costs in real-time. See exactly what each request costs at both the request and project level, with Design costs separated from Development for complete visibility into your AI spend.

### **💬 Persistent Conversation History**

Your Tyler Application feature conversations now persist across sessions. Jump between tabs without losing context—all your historic messages automatically load when you return.

### **🎯 Streamlined Navigation**

We've reorganized the Tyler Application Project left menu for a more intuitive workflow, and introduced a dedicated Administration Tab to keep your project management clean and focused.

## Web Applications

### **✉️ Beautiful Email Templates**

Sign-up and password reset emails now feature professionally designed HTML templates that we can customize for special announcements and updates.
