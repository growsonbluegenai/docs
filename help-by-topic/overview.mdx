<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Codebase">
    Codebase allows you to view and interact directly with the application code. This transparency supports compliance reviews, quality checks, and other forms of validation. You can access the Codebase from the toolbar. 

    **If you’re an advanced technical user**

    Codebase also enables small, targeted adjustments and makes it easy to reference specific files or snippets when collaborating with teammates or when guiding the AI to refine or extend the application.

    Remember! Codebase is completely optional. You can build a full, production-ready application using BlueGenAI without ever opening the Codebase view.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Collaboration">
    You can use the collaboration feature to invite teammates or stakeholders to a shared project, manage access with roles, and choose a billing model that fits your work. 

    You can manage collaborations from the project landing page. Each project card has a more options menu where you can find and manage collaborations. 

    **Invite collaborators, assign roles, set permissions**

    - Owner: Full control of the project, collaboration settings, and billing rules.
    - Editor: Contribute to the project content, help evolve the design and build outputs.
    - Viewer: Read-only access for review and feedback.

    **Generate a shareable link **

    - Enable artifact link sharing to let people outside BlueGenAI view your outputs, which is useful for reviews, presentations, or sharing deliverables.
    - Use a shareable link for a project to streamline demos and reviews. 
    - Turn off share links when reviews are complete, especially for sensitive projects.

    **Set up Flexible billing for teams**

    - You choose how usage is billed: the project owner can cover all costs, or collaborators can pay individually. 
    - Billing preferences are set per invitee, making it easy to support client projects or mixed-organization teams.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Design System">
    Using the design system is a quick and easy way to apply themes and modify UI elements without writing prompts. You can access the design system from the toolbar. 

    **Design System Benefits**

    - Update the look & feel of your application without writing prompts.
    - Apply themes that reflect your client’s brand identity.
    - All design changes adhere to  government accessibility guidelines.

    **Tip:** You can also apply your client’s design system by writing a prompt to do so.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Files">
    Files are key to using BlueGenAI. They can be system-generated, like the files created while you’re designing the application, or they can be uploaded from outside of the platform and referenced as you design and build. 

    You can access a complete list of files from the tool bar.

    **System Generated Files**

    - When working in design mode, each time you write a prompt and ask the agent to process it, the agent produces a file (as represented by the blue card with the code icon.)
    - The system will produce new versions of the file every time you iterate on the design.
    - In most cases, this file represents the HTML, but you can prompt the agent to create requirements documentation as well.  

    **User Uploaded Files**

    You can upload external files to reference while designing your solution. 

    - User Profiles - Admin and Users
    - UI Guidance
    - Images
    - Requirements Documentation
    - Government Solicitations
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Integration Credentials & Keys">
    The agent generates integration credentials during the build phase in support of security, governance, and compliance. You can access the credentials from the tool bar to manage authentication and environment variables.

    **Service & Integration Credentials**

    These credentials allow the application to connect to external systems while keeping sensitive keys secure and auditable.

    - APIs, databases, document repositories, cloud or email services
    - Stored securely in a secrets manager or vault
    - Referenced by the agent during build and by the app at runtime
    - Never hard-coded into prompts or source code

    \
    **Tip:** The agent might create credentials you don’t need. You can ignore them.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Requirement Folders">
    Requirement Folders help you organize your project into clear, manageable sections. Each folder represents a Functional Requirement Group, meaning a logical grouping of related requirements that describe a discrete area of the application.

    **Common Organizations**

    - Major capabilities or feature areas (Intake, Case Management, Reporting)
    - Individual screens or modules (Login, Admin Panel, Dashboard)
    - Process steps or workflows (Submit, Review, Approve)
    - Any structure that matches how you plan, build, and discuss the system

    **Big advantages**

    - This structure lets you focus on one feature, screen, or workflow at a time instead of treating the application as one large set of requirements. 
    - It also supports team-based delivery, where different users can own and contribute to different areas of the design using BlueGenAI collaboration capabilities.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="URLs">
    The URLs panel provides quick access to the live endpoints for your deployed application. It surfaces the primary Application URL as well as any additional URLs that may be useful during development, testing, or integration, such as the Backend API Endpoint. 

    URLs are read only, reference information. Use them to open the running application, share a link with teammates, or connect external tools and services to specific endpoints when needed.

    You can access a complete list of system generated URLs from the toolbar.
