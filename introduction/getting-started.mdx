    You will need to [create an account here](https://www.bluegenai.ai/signup)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Step 1">
    Log into [<u>BlueGenAI.ai</u>](http://BlueGenAI.ai) and click on Create a Project.  There are no restrictions for naming the project. The client field is optional. 
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Step 2">
    Use Design Mode to design and organize your application. In Design Mode, you are playing the role of the product and UI designer. 

    Create a Requirements Folder to start your design. Think of the requirements folders as a way to organize your approach to designing and building. 

    Start the design by writing prompts that include the users, the outcome and any constraints. 

    Prompt Example

    - Write this: Build an intake application that allows residents to submit requests for a license permit and routes them to the correct program.
    - Not this: Create a form with fields and logic.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Step 3">
    Save files in Design Mode. Once the agent has completed a prompt, it generates a file. In this case the file is the text/HTML. Save the file to reference when building the application. 

    You can also upload external support files like images or requirements documentation to use as a reference when designing your application.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Step 4">
    Click on Build Mode to build your application. In Build Mode, you are playing the role of the developer.  

    Start the build by entering a prompt and attaching related files as a reference. You can find a complete list of files by clicking the file icon in the toolbar. 

    The agent will build your application and generate the application link. You can return to the application link by clicking the link icon in the toolbar.

    **Tips**: Writing clear and concise prompts allows the agent to process quickly which allows for faster iterations on your design.
