### Considerations for Target Application

**Program Outcome **

Source: business goals, SOW, RFX, an initial conversation

**Users and Accessibility**

Source: user interviews, focus groups, user profiles, accessibility guidelines

**Data Inputs (if known)**

Source: APIs, legacy systems, data sources

**Initial Scope**

Source: existing requirements or applications, process flows, user stories, design systems

_This doesn’t need to be complete. Even a rough starting point helps steer generation._

**Potential Constraints**

Source: security, compliance, sensitive data

_Details can be refined as you go._\
