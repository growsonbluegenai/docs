<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Working in Design Mode">
    Projects default to design mode, where you can operate in a designer role, rapidly adjusting structure, layout, and UI patterns. While it isn’t the only starting point, it’s optimized for fast iteration and early alignment on the application’s experience.

    When working in design mode, you can upload external files for reference when designing. These files can be uploaded using the file icon in the toolbar. 

    File Upload Examples

    - User Profiles - Admin and Users
    - UI Guidance
    - Images
    - Requirements Documentation
    - Government Solicitations

    Design mode also allows you to reference existing applications, websites or design systems simply by adding a link in the prompt. 

    Examples 

    - State or local design system
    - Comparable application
    - External or internal website

    \
    \*\*Tip: \*\*You don’t have to start in design mode. You can go straight to build.

  <Accordion title="Design Small, Build Big">
    Designing small does not mean thinking small. It means being intentional about scope.

    **Why starting small helps you:**

    Reduce risk early\
    A narrowly scoped solution is easier to test and correct than a complex one.

    Avoid rework\
    Scaling a proven solution is far easier than scaling back an overly complex one.

    Build stakeholder confidence\
    Demonstrating a focused, reliable use case makes it easier to gain approval for future expansion.

    **How to design small and with clear intention:**

    - Focus on one clear business problem
    - Start with a small set of tasks
    - Use minimal, well-defined data sources
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Start with a Statement of Work">
    BlueGenAI’s agent is designed to support the public sector specifically. This means you can use the solicitation to help drive your build. 

    Ideas for using the SOW

    - Copy and paste any or all of the statement of work in design mode and prompt the agent to create the solution. Not the fastest approach, but doable. 
    - Prompt the agent to generate placeholder data to build a fully functioning prototype. If you want to demo the prototype, you can ask the agent to create placeholder data to reflect a live application. 
    - Upload the statement of work to your files and reference it in your prompts.

      **Tip:** Use BlueGenAi’s <u>Design Studio</u> to apply your client’s look & feel.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Start with an Existing Application">
    Starting with an existing application can be a faster way to approach building a new application or improving upon an existing one. 

    Step 1: Start in design mode and paste a link to the existing application. 

    Step 2: Write a prompt to provide clear and concise direction.

    Prompt Example: 

    - Update this application to simplify the language and reduce the number of required fields.  
    - The goal is to Improve completion rate for users
    - Ensure all changes maintain accessibility and compliance with government web standards

    Step 3: Once you’ve achieved the mock ups and work flows in design mode, save the file (indicated by the blue card with the code icon) and move to build mode to complete the build. \
    \
    **Tip**: You can ask the agent to create requirements documents, project charters and road maps to support your application build or share with your customers.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use the Design System for Quick Look & Feel Changes">
    Using the Design System to apply new themes doesn’t require tokens or written prompts. You can access the design system in the toolbar. 

    Design System Benefits

    - Update the look & feel of your application without writing prompts.
    - Apply themes that reflect your client’s brand identity.
    - All design changes adhere to  government accessibility guidelines.

    \
    **Tip:** You can also apply your client’s design system by writing a prompt.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Manage Token Usage">
    Follow these tips to manage token usage.

    - Start with narrow prompts.
    - Reference only necessary documents.
    - Reuse saved outputs instead of regenerating.
    - Limit iterations until direction is clear.
    - Test in small pilots before scaling.
